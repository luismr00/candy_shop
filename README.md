# Candy Shop Program

## Introduction 

Candy Shop program coded in Ruby Language. The following instructions necessary to complete a coding challenge that consist of:

### Instructions:

* Three classes should be created: shop, shelf, and candy. Each shop should know how many shelves it contains. 
* Each shelf should know how many and which candies it contains. 
* Each candy should know its name and whether or not it has been shelved. 

### Functionality

* Four files in total (one for each class and one to serve as an entry point into the application, such as init.rb).
* When a new candy is created, it is immediately added to the store as a candy that has yet to be placed on a shelf.
* Each candy should immediately enter the shop as an unshelved candy.
* A shop should be able to remove or add a shelf.
* It should be possible to move a candy from the list of unshelved candies to a shelf and vice versa. 
* A shop should be able to list all of the candies it stocks on its shelves.
* When a new shelf is initialized, it should immediately be added to a shop.

## Program Brief Explanation

The program covers all functions and instructions requested for the coding challenge. Although, some methods could have been created to improve the program. These weren't necessary, but such examples that could be added are:

* More input validation throughout the menu navigation and other areas
* Additional stores to navigate (more objects)
* Less code for some of the methods
* Saving option

Of course, these improvements can always be made. Yet considering the limited time for the coding challenge deadline, covering all instructions first was the main priority.
